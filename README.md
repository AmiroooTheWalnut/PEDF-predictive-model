# PEDF_simple
Prediction model for sequential data used for process mining. It can learn sequences and predict a partially known sequence.  
There are two libraries to be compared with PEDF i.e. Deeplearning4j and SPMF.  
 * For DeepLearning4j RANN model you can refer to the codes of the root directory (./RANN) which are preprocessing codes written in Matlab. Main code is in folder ./RANN/deeplearning4jTest/dl4j-examples/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/examples/recurrent/Amirooo.  
 * The actual code is "MyRecurrentTrafficFineMasked.java".  
 * SPMF code is in directory ./SPMF/src/spmftest.  
 * PEDF code is inside a Netbeans project structure. The source code is inside "src" folder and the compiled code is in "dist" folder.
