# PEDF_simple
Prediction model for sequential data used for process mining. It can learn sequences and predict a partially known sequence.  
There are two libraries to be compared with PEDF i.e. Deeplearning4j and SPMF.  
For DeepLearning4j RANN model you can refer to the codes of the root directory (./RANN) which are preprocessing codes written in Matlab. Main code is in folder ./RANN/deeplearning4jTest/dl4j-examples/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/examples/recurrent/Amirooo.  
The correct code is "MyRecurrentTrafficFineMasked.java".  
SPMF code is in directory ./SPMF/src/spmftest.  
PEDF code is inside a Netbeans project structure. The code is inside "src" folder and the compiled code is in "dist" folder.
